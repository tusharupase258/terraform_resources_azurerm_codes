Azure Provider Features Block

The Azure Provider allows the behavior of certain resources to be configured using the features block. This allows different users to select the behavior they require.

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {} # Use the feature block to enable basic functionality
}

terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "3.112.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {} # Configuration options # Here the feature block is used.
}

# If you wish to use the default behaviors of the Azure Provider, then you only need to define an empty features block as below:

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

Each of the blocks defined below can be optionally specified to configure the behavior as needed.
